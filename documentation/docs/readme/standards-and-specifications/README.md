# Standards & Specifications

At MOSIP (Modular Open Source Identity Platform), we are committed to building a secure, interoperable, and privacy-centric identity system for nations worldwide. MOSIP adheres to internationally recognized standards in biometric authentication, security, cryptography, privacy, and interoperability to ensure the highest levels of security, efficiency, and compliance.

#### **1. Why Standards Matters?** <a href="#id-1.-why-standard-matters" id="id-1.-why-standard-matters"></a>

By following these global standards, MOSIP ensures that our identity platform is:\
\
✅ **Secure** – Protecting citizens’ data from cyber threats.\
✅ **Privacy-First** – Upholding the highest standards of data protection.\
✅ **Scalable & Future-Ready** – Enabling nations to build robust digital identity programs.\
✅ **Interoperable** – Seamlessly integrating with digital identity solutions worldwide.

### **1. Biometric Standards for Secure Identity Verification** <a href="#id-1.-biometric-standards-for-secure-identity-verification" id="id-1.-biometric-standards-for-secure-identity-verification"></a>

To ensure seamless biometric interoperability and security, MOSIP follows:

* **ISO/IEC 19794** – Standardized biometric data formats for fingerprints, iris, and facial recognition.
* **CBEFF (Common Biometric Exchange Formats Framework)** – Facilitates interoperability and efficient biometric data exchange.
* **IEEE P3167 (DRAFT)** – Strengthening the trustworthiness of biometric devices and their captured data while ensuring overall data security.

### **2. Security & Cryptography Standards for Data Protection** <a href="#id-2.-security-and-cryptography-standards-for-data-protection" id="id-2.-security-and-cryptography-standards-for-data-protection"></a>

To guarantee robust data security and encryption, MOSIP aligns with:

* **NIST Cybersecurity Framework** – Provides guidelines for IT security evaluation and risk management.
* **RSA, EC, JSE** – Implements industry-standard cryptographic algorithms for secure encryption and data integrity.

### **3. Open Standards for Seamless Interoperability** <a href="#id-3.-open-standards-for-seamless-interoperability" id="id-3.-open-standards-for-seamless-interoperability"></a>

To enable effortless integration with national and global identity ecosystems, MOSIP adopts:

* **OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect** – Providing secure and scalable authentication mechanisms.
* **REST, OpenAPI Standards** – Ensuring standardized communication across different platforms.
* **JMS (Java Message Service) & WebSub** – Facilitating real-time messaging and event-driven architecture.
