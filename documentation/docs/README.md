### **Welcome !üåç**

#### **What is MOSIP?**

**Modular Open-Source Identity Platform (MOSIP)** is an open-source, open standards-based [foundational identity platform](https://docs.mosip.io/1.2.0/readme/overview#what-is-a-foundational-id-system) designed to help countries build and manage their national ID systems. Anchored at the [International Institute of Information Technology, Bangalore (IIIT-B)](https://www.iiitb.ac.in/), MOSIP enables governments to conceive, develop, implement, and own secure and scalable digital identity solutions.

Built with an API-first approach, MOSIP provides [ID Lifecycle Management](https://docs.mosip.io/1.2.0/id-lifecycle-management) features, covering [Identity Issuance](https://docs.mosip.io/1.2.0/id-lifecycle-management/identity-issuance), [Identity Verification](https://docs.mosip.io/1.2.0/id-lifecycle-management/identity-verification), and [Identity Management](https://docs.mosip.io/1.2.0/id-lifecycle-management/identity-management). The platform is designed to foster global Digital Public Goods (DPGs) in digital identification and governance. By leveraging open-source technologies, MOSIP ensures scalability, security, and privacy, adhering to best industry practices.

MOSIP‚Äôs modular and adaptable architecture gives adopting countries full ownership and flexibility to customize the system to their needs. As a transparent and human-centric initiative, MOSIP encourages global collaboration, welcoming contributions from developers, technology partners, and research institutions worldwide.

Our global team of experts and advisors supports countries throughout the adoption and implementation of their digital ID systems, ensuring that they function as a common governance infrastructure for inclusive and secure digital transformation.

#### **Our Mission & Objectives**

At MOSIP, our mission is to empower governments worldwide to build and own secure, inclusive, and scalable digital identity systems. As an open-source, modular platform, MOSIP provides a strong foundation for nations to establish their digital public infrastructure, ensuring privacy, security, and interoperability.

Our key objectives include:

* **Enabling countries to develop secure, citizen-centric ID systems** by providing a robust and fully functional **framework**.
* **Offering flexibility and customization** so that nations can tailor the platform to their specific needs.
* **Ensuring privacy, security, and confidentiality** of individuals‚Äô data, following global best practices.
* **Upholding transparency, security, and human-centric technology** to foster trust and reliability.
* **Supporting global collaboration** through open-source contributions, partnerships, and an ecosystem of technology providers, researchers, and developers.
* **Providing a scalable and accessible solution** that serves populations from a few thousand to several hundred million.

By fostering an open and collaborative ecosystem of technology partners, researchers, and developers, MOSIP enables nations to build robust, adaptable, and future-ready identity solutions tailored to their unique needs.

#### **Why MOSIP?**

**1. Modular**

MOSIP‚Äôs mutually exclusive technology bundles allow adopting nations to build custom workflows instead of relying on a fixed system. Each functionality is designed as an independent microservice, ensuring flexibility and control over digital ID implementation.

**2. Open Source**

We are committed to developing trusted and transparent technology while contributing to global standards. Our open-source code repository is available entirely on [GitHub](https://github.com/mosip), encouraging contributions from user communities and providing governments with full control over their ID systems. MOSIP actively collaborates with IEEE, governments, and industry partners to establish common Open Standards and Protocols, making MOSIP easy to integrate, interoperable, cost-effective, and time-efficient.

**3. Vendor-Neutral**

We offer governments the ability to integrate with a wide range of compliant technology partners. A foundational digital ID system requires smooth integration of platforms, biometric devices, and system integrators. MOSIP ensures vendor neutrality through the MOSIP Partner Programme and [Marketplace](https://marketplace.mosip.io/), allowing countries to choose and update their technology solutions freely, saving both time and financial resources.

**4. Secure and Private Design**

We believe every individual should be in control of their own data. MOSIP ensures data security and privacy, with cryptographic encryption and zero-knowledge architecture safeguarding information both in transit and at rest. Governments retain sovereign control over their ID systems, and data sharing occurs only with the individual‚Äôs consent.\

**5. Cost-Effective**

MOSIP provides a zero-cost platform for adoption and licensing, enabling governments and organizations to build a foundational digital ID system under Mozilla‚Äôs Public License 2.0. The automation of processes within MOSIP minimizes implementation costs, allowing countries to test and establish effective digital infrastructure efficiently.

**6. Human-Centric**

We aim to develop technology that can cater to diverse and varying requirements around the world. The expert team at MOSIP constantly strives to learn from on-ground experiences in adopting nations, to understand their context-specific requirements and provide unique and adaptable solutions.

**7. Inclusive**

MOSIP is committed to inclusivity, ensuring technology remains accessible to all, regardless of gender, race, or economic status. Our ongoing collaborations with universities, research institutions, and field teams help refine our technology for unrestricted accessibility. Innovations like Inji, a digital wallet mobile app, empower residents to access their digital identities even in remote, low-connectivity areas.
