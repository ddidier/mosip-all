## Minor upgrade
This is termed as minor as this flow is created to handle hotfixes or required fixes on the same version of Registration Client. 
If available, it is initiated on Registration Client startup and cannot be stopped manually.

## Version upgrade
As the name suggests, this flow explains the upgrade of Registration Client from one version to another. On need basis, the Registration Operator can choose to *upgrade later* for not more than configured number of days.
