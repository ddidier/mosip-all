# Collab Environment Guides

Hello Partner!&#x20;

Ready to delve deeper into the world of MOSIP? This expanded guide sheds light on the functionalities and benefits of each service and module available in the Collab environment. Explore, test, and build with confidence!

Let us dive deeper into MOSIP Collab: Modules in detail.

### Introduction

The Collab environment in [MOSIP ](https://docs.mosip.io/1.2.0/)offers a collaborative platform for partners and stakeholders to thoroughly test, collaborate, and validate their integrations, modules, and services. This environment is exclusively designed for partners and contributors involved in developing solutions on the MOSIP platform enabling them to perform comprehensive testing and seamless integration of their solutions with the latest platform code. To gain access to this environment, please click [here](https://collab.mosip.net/).

### Purpose

This guide has been created to offer a step-by-step overview of the fundamental procedures that as a partner, you must adhere to, to begin working with the Collab environment. By carefully following the setup and configuration process, which is outlined module by module within this guide, you will be able to effortlessly access the Collab environment, establish the necessary modules or services, and effectively demonstrate the application features as relevant.

### Pre-requisites

Before starting with the Collab environment, please ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

* **UIN Credential (Unique Identification Number)** \
  Issuance of [UIN](https://docs.mosip.io/1.2.0/id-lifecycle-management/identifiers#uin) as a demo credential will allow you to explore MOSIP's capabilities and experience seamless identity management firsthand. Provide your details in this UIN generation [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc2I0CQqlYRIrEmcJ3J3tKlYOVNcYNj88YZe4MMwU2RZTrjOA/viewform), and we'll generate demo credentials that will enable you to navigate through different modules.
* **MOCK SMTP** \
  A mock SMTP server is a simulated email server used for testing and development purposes. In MOSIP, it is installed as part of the default installation and is utilized to mimic the behavior of a real SMTP server, allowing developers to test email functionality and interactions without sending actual emails. To set up a mock SMTP server for the message gateway during V3 installation, click [here](https://docs.mosip.io/1.2.0/deploymentnew/v3-installation/mosip-external-dependencies#msg-gateway).
