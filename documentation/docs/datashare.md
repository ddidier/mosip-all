# Datashare

## Overview

The DataShare service is used to share data with other entrusted services and partners. The mechanism shares are the following:

1. Retrieves and stores data to be shared in [Object Store](object-store.md) and returns a Datashare URL.
2. It fetches data from the Object Store when the Datashare URL is called.

The sharing of data is controlled by the [Datashare policy](modules/partner-management-services/pms-existing/partner-policies.md#datashare-policy).

Data is encrypted before sharing it with partners. Learn more about [datashare encryption](data-protection.md#datashare).

The relationship of Datashare Service with other services is explained here. _NOTE: The numbers do not signify the sequence of operations or control flow. Arrows indicate the data flow._
