## Login

The partners using the compliance tool kit should be registered in the system. Registered partners can log in to the compliance tool kit with the same credentials as they used to register themselves into the [Partner Management Portal](https://docs.mosip.io/1.2.0/modules/partner-management-services/partner-management-portal).

The partner needs to enter the registered username or e-mail and password to log in.

## Dashboards
  
Once the partner logs into the compliance tool kit, they can view the `Project Dashboard` by default and would have the option to view the `Biometric Data Dashboard` as well.
 
* `Project`: A project is a module that the partner wants to test. For example, if a device partner has developed a new version of their SBI for the fingerprint slap device, then, they can create a project in the compliance tool kit to verify this version of SBI.  

![CTK Project Dashboard](_images/ctk-toolkit-dashboard.png)

* `Biometric Data`: As a part of the CTK, there is an option for the partner to upload their test data which can be used to verify the partner’s software. Currently, in MOSIP, we can upload test data for an SDK.

### Run an SBI collection
   
* Before running a collection in SBI, the partner needs to connect to a device without which they cannot proceed with testing.
* The partner should click on the `Scan Device` button in the Collection Dashboard as shown below.
 
![](_images/ctk-scan-device.png) 
    
* This triggers a scan of all the configured ports in the system where the SBI is connected.
* If any device connected with an SBI is found, the application asks the partner to select an available port and the device for running the test.

![](_images/ctk-scan-device-selection.png) 

* If any device is not found, an error popup is displayed to the partner with an option to `Scan Again`.
     
![](_images/ctk-scan-failed.png) 
   
* Once the device is selected, the partner can click on the `Save` button.
* After the device is selected and saved in memory, the `Run` button for the collections is enabled.
   
![](_images/ctk-run-button.png) 
  
* If a device is already scanned and selected before running the collection, the partner can choose to re-scan and select another device for running the test case.
* If a device is selected, the partner can click on the `Run` button to run the test case.
* If the partner selects a Fingerprint Slap device but the collection is for a Double Iris device, then the test case is not executed. The partner will be shown an error message and asked to re-select the correct device. The combination validated here is for Purpose, Device Type and Sub Type as displayed below.

![](_images/ctk-combination-validation.png) 
 
* If the correct device is selected and the partner initiates the test run, the test case execution should start.
* During the test run,
    * A progress bar will be shown with the percentage of tests execution completed
    * A timer to show the time elapsed during the execution
    * Option to close or cancel the test run
    * Option to initiate capture for a test case or resume run after completing the operation.

![](_images/ctk-test-run.png) 
 
* The test run also shows,
    * The total test cases getting executed for that run
    * The current test case name
    * Instructions (if any) for the partner to follow
 
* Once the test execution is completed, the partner can see,
    * A high-level result with the number of test cases executed- with the number of test cases failed and the number of test cases passed in the run.
 
![](_images/ctk-run-result.png) 
  
    * The partner can also see the time elapsed
    * They can also view the detailed test run report
 
![](_images/ctk-run-details.png) 
  
### Run an SDK collection
  
Before running the SDK collection, the partner can change the `Test Data` and the `Base URL` in the project settings

![](_images/ctk-sdk-change-url-testdata.png) 
 
* Click the `Run` button of the specific collection.
* The application now checks if the URL shared by the partner is accessible or not. If not accessible, the application shows an error message to the partner.

![](_images/ctk-sdk-url-notaccessible.png) 
  
* Once the run initiates with the proper URL, the execution should complete on its own and during the run, the partner can see:
    * A progress bar with the percentage of test execution completed.
    * A timer to show the time elapsed during the execution.
    * Option to close or cancel the test run.

![](_images/ctk-sdk-run.png) 

* Once the test execution is completed, the partner can see:
    * A high-level result with the number of test cases executed- with the number of test cases failed and the number of test cases passed in the run.
    * They can also see the time elapsed.
    * They also have the option to view the detailed `Test Run` report.

![](_images/ctk-sdk-run-result.png) 
   
_Note_: For a test run, the partner can select their data or MOSIP’s default data. But let us assume that the partner chooses their data, but in the ZIP file, they have missed adding data for a particular test case, then the system should take MOSIP’s data for the test case' execution.
  
![](_images/ctk-testdata-selecting.png) 
   
### View the run history of the collection
   
The partner after completing a successful test run can view the detailed run by,
   
* Clicking on the `View Test Run` button once the test execution is completed.
