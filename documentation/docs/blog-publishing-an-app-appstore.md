# Releasing an app to Apple App Store

In this post, you will be taken through the step-by-step process to release an app to iOS AppStore (content is updated as per process followed until 11 April'23).

Similar steps were followed to release the **Inji** app. To know more about Inji, refer [Inji documentation](https://docs.mosip.io/inji/).


**_App Store Connect_**:

An Apple portal to manage Developer certificates like APNs certificates, Provisioning profile, devices for adhoc distribution, APNs key, etc.

**Pre-requisites**

* Apple ID (email & password used to login to any apple’s portal)

* Ensure the targeted users of your app are public, otherwise you may lead to rejection from Apple’s app review team. For example, if your targeted users are employees of an organization, you have to go with Apple Developer Enterprise Program rather than Apple Developer Program.
  
* Go through different type of memberships of Apple, refer [Choosing a Membership - Support - Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com/support/compare-memberships/).

* [Custom Apps - Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com/custom-apps/)

If your app is intended for AppStore distribution, you need **Apple Developer Program** membership. Check the eligibility by login into [Apple Developer](http://developer.apple.com/).

If you have relevant access, you will be able to see `Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles` under the `Program resources` section. If you do not have an eligible **Apple Developer Program**, please do the enrollment.

[Before You Enroll - Apple Developer Program](https://developer.apple.com/programs/enroll/)  (payment is involved, about 99 USD or 8,700 INR per year, you may need to add this amount to your Apple ID).
