## Sharing credentials

Prerequisites:

* Two or more devices with the Resident Mobile app installed are required for sharing credentials.
* All required permissions like Bluetooth, location and camera access are enabled on both the devices.
* The parties involved are mostly likely a Resident who would want to share their credentials with a Relying party (can be with a banker/ health worker/ etc).

Let us understand sharing of credentials with an example.

Assuming that a Resident having Device A wants to share their credentials with a Relying/ requesting party having Device B. The steps that both the parties have to follow is illustrated below:

1\. The Resident taps on `Scan` icon on their phone (on the bottom menu, second icon from left).

Click **OK** to turn on the device' location.

3\. The Resident' device is ready for scanning the QR code that will be displayed on the Relying party' phone.

4\. On the Relying party' phone, tap the `Request icon`(on the bottom menu, third icon from left).

Tap **Allow** to enable bluetooth on Device B.

* Device Reference number
* Reason for sharing (optional)
