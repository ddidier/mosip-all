# CTK Test Cases

Compliance Tool Kit (CTK) is an online portal that can be used by MOSIP partners to test the compliance of their product developed as per the specifications (specs) published by MOSIP. CTK currently supports compliance verification of SBI and SDK specifications.

## What are the CTK test cases?

To verify the compliance of the partner software with MOSIP specifications, MOSIP has created predefined test cases for the type of specification. 

* Each test case in CTK runs on a given method of the specs. For example, there will be a test case for the `device` method of SBI specs.
* Each test case in CTK defines the attributes required to create the request to be sent to the partner application.
* Each test case also defines the response expected from the partner application.
* Each test case also defines the validators to be run in the response received.
* Each validator also performs a predefined check on the response.
* If all validations are successful, then the test case is considered as passed, otherwise the test case fails.

Partners can use CTK to run these test cases to verify if their implementation adheres to the MOSIP’s specs or not. 

These test cases are defined in JSON format and saved in the CTK database.

## Sample SBI test case

This test case is for verifying the **check device discovery** endpoint of an SBI. This test case is available for both `Registration` and `Auth` SBI projects and all `device type` and `sub type` combinations.

```jsonc
{
   "testCaseType": "SBI",
   "testName": "Discover device",
   "testId": "SBI1000",
   "specVersion": "0.9.5",
   "testDescription": "This test case verifies schema and signature of the device discovery interface",
   "isNegativeTestcase": false,
   "methodName": [
      "device"
   ],
   "requestSchema": [
      "DiscoverRequestSchema"
   ],
   "responseSchema": [
      "DiscoverResponseSchema"
   ],
   "validatorDefs": [
      [
         {
            "name": "SchemaValidator",
            "description": "Validates the response for mandatory attributes and  values"
         },
         {
            "name": "SignatureValidator",
            "description": "Validates the response signature"
         }
      ]
   ],
   "otherAttributes": {
      "purpose": [
         "Registration",
         "Auth"
      ],
      "biometricTypes": [
         "Finger",
         "Iris",
         "Face"
      ],
      "deviceSubTypes": [
         "Slap",
         "Single",
         "Double",
         "Full face"
      ],
      "segments": [
         
      ],
      "exceptions": [
         
      ],
      "requestedScore": "",
      "bioCount": "",
      "deviceSubId": ""
   }
}
```

## Sample SDK test case

This test case is for verifying the **quality of face biometrics** (if it is above the acceptable threshold). This test case will be available for `Face modality` only and for the `Quality Check project`.

```jsonc
{
   "testCaseType": "SDK",
   "testName": "Good face quality",
   "testId": "SDK2001",
   "testDescription": "This test case verifies the biometrics for the face to be of good quality.",
   "specVersion": "0.9.0",
   "isNegativeTestcase": false,
   "methodName": [
      "check-quality"
   ],
   "requestSchema": [
      "CheckQualityRequestSchema"
   ],
   "responseSchema": [
      "CheckQualityResponseSchema"
   ],
   "validatorDefs": [
      [
         {
            "name": "SchemaValidator",
            "description": "Validates if the response has all mandatory attributes and they have allowed values"
         },
         {
            "name": "QualityCheckValidator",
            "description": "Checks the quality score of the modality"
         }
      ]
   ],
   "otherAttributes":{
      "modalities":[
         "face"
      ],
      "sdkPurpose":[
         "Check Quality"
      ]
   }
}
```

## Attributes in a test case

As it can be seen from the above two samples, few attributes are common across the test cases for both SBI and SDK while few are optional. Below is the list of each attribute and its use.

| Name   | Type  | Description | Allowed Values |
|-----------------|-------------------|---------------|-----------|
|`testCaseType`  | Required | Type of test case  |SBI / SDK / ABIS|
|`testName` | Required | Name of test case  ||
|`testId `| Required |Unique ID for test case  | SBI10XX, SDK20XX|
|`specVersion `| Required  | Spec version being tested | 0.9.5/1.0.0 for SBI, <br> 0.9.0 for SDK|
|`testDescription`| Required | Test description. It can also include the steps to execute the test case.  |  |
|`isNegativeTestcase` | Required  | Indicates if the validator is for a positive or a negative scenario.  | E.g.: for a bad face quality test, we expect a low score which is a negative scenario, so the validator should mark the test case as passed on receiving low score |
|`methodName` | Required | The name of the method to be invoked for the test case.  <br> It accepts an array. <br> <br> For SBI, this array will have only one value.  <br><br> For SDK, in case of a combination test case you can give 2 method names. <br> E.g.: ["extract-template", "check-quality"] | device(SBI), info(SBI), capture(SBI), rcapture(SBI), stream(SBI), insert(ABIS), identify(ABIS), delete(ABIS), init(SDK), check-quality(SDK), match(SDK), extract-template(SDK), convert-format(SDK), segment(SDK)|
|`requestSchema`|Required|Name of the JSON schema file which will be used to validate the HTTP request. This HTTP request will be used to invoke the HTTP method defined in the spec. <br> It accepts an array. <br>  <br> For SBI, this array will have only one value. <br> <br> For SDK, in case of a combination test case you can give 2 request schema names. <br> E.g: ["ExtractTemplateRequestSchema", "MatchRequestSchema"]|The request schema JSON files are saved in the MINIO in the following folder structure. <br> E.g.: compliance-toolkit/schemas/sbi/0.9.5/ DiscoverRequestSchema.json|
|`responseSchema`|Required|Name of the JSON schema file which will be used to validate the HTTP response. This is the HTTP response that we will receive after invoking the HTTP method.<br> It accepts an array. <br><br> For SBI, this array will have only one value <br><br> For SDK, in case of a combination test case you can give 2 request schema names. <br> E.g.: ["ExtractTemplateResponseSchema", "MatchResponseSchema"]|The response schema JSON files are saved in the MINIO in the following folder structure. <br> E.g.: compliance-toolkit/schemas/sbi/0.9.5/ DiscoverResponseSchema.json|
|`validatorDefs`|Required|Names of Validators that are to be invoked to run various validations on the response. <br> It accepts an array of arrays.<br> <br> Each array is a list of validators to be applied to the response of the corresponding method in the test case.<br> <br> In the case of SBI, it is an array with a single array. <br> <br> In the case of SDK, for a combination test case it can be an array with a list of arrays.| Validators are available in the folder: `compliance-toolkit\src\main\java\io\mosip\compliance\toolkit\validators`|

## How to add a test case to the Database

Any new test case is to be uploaded to the database. You can also update an existing test case using the same steps.

1\. Open postman and create a POST request.

2\. URL endpoint `https://{base_URL}/v1/toolkit/saveTestCases`

3\. Copy the `Authorization` token in the request header by logging into the Compliance Toolkit in your env with a user having a `GLOBAL_ADMIN` role. Open the developer tools and copy the Authorization token from the headers section under the `Networks` tab. Add the Authorization token in postman, copy the token and place it in the headers section of the request (`Cookie=Authorization:eyAjksa...`)

4\. Copy the test cases array JSON and prepare a request as shown below.

5\. Request body for saveTestCases request 

```jsonc
{
    "version": "1.0",
    "requesttime": "2022-10-29T06:06:51.174Z",
    "metadata": null,
    "request": {
        "testCases": [
<Paste the testcases here>
        ]
    }
}
```

6\. Change the `requesttime` to the current day and send the request.
