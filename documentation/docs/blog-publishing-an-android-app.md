### Signing and Key 

Generating a release keystore

```
keytool \

 -genkey -v \

 -storetype PKCS12 \

 -keyalg RSA \

 -keysize 2048 \

 -validity 10000 \

 -storepass '<use-your-store-password>' \ 

 -keypass '<use-your-store-password>' \

 -alias <use-app-name-as-alias> \

 -keystore android/app/release.keystore \

 -dname "CN=io.mosip.residentapp,OU=,O=,L=,S=,C=US"

  ```

**NOTES (Keystore)**:

* For release, you will need a release keystore for play store to accept it. Using a debug keystore and signing our app, Play Store will reject the apk/app bundle.

* Once the release keystore is generated, you will need to keep it very safely as this is the file which is used to sign and update the app in the play store.

* You cannot create a new keystore with the same credentials to update the app since it has a timestamp associated with it. If you try to upload with that, play store will reject it saying it is signed with the wrong keystore.

* YOu can only update the app with the same keystore that you have generated and used to sign the app for the first time.

* While signing the app in the pipeline, encode the keystore file (Do not encode the file content, instead encode the file itself) using base64 and keeping it as a secret (if you are using Github) and decode it in the build time to sign the application.

* Store password and key password should be the same as we are using PKCS12 file type.

* Alias name is a label using your application name is a good practice.

  * **CN** - the full name of the person or organization that generates the `.keystore`.

  * **OU** -  Organizational Unit that creates the project, it's a subdivision of the Organization that creates it. E.g.: [](android.google.com)

  * **O** - Organization owner of the whole project. It's a higher scope than OU. E.g.: [](google.com)

  * **C** - The country's short code. E.g.: For United States is "US"

**Pre-requisites**: 

* Google play developer account (used to login to Google play console) with Play Publisher rights.

* Signed APK or App bundle.

* App integrity 

    * This is a signing key and it will be automatically generated and managed by google if you choose google play to manage it. 

    * This signing key is not related to the release keystore that we are using. 

    * This signing key is generated based on the keystore that we have used to sign the app while building the application.

* App bundle 

    * Generate a signed apk or app bundle and upload the same.

    * Keep the keystore safe in secrets or somewhere safe as we need to use the same keystore for future signing of the app.

![](\_images/app-image23.png) 

* **Release details**

    * Release name is the version name.

#### Step 5: Giving the app to Internal testers

Congratulations, you have successfully done all the steps needed for the Internal release. Let’s see how we can give the apk to testers.

* In the Internal testing tab, you can see your app status is active and says it is available to internal testers.

* To provide the apk to testers, click on testers in the Internal testing tab.

* You can see the list of testers, select the testers list you want to share this apk with.

* Once selected click on save and this will save the changes.

* You will be able to see the Copy link option.

* Copy the link and give it to testers, they will be able to download the app from play store.

![](\_images/app-image24.png) 

Things to keep in mind once it is uploaded to the play store,

* You will need to share the link manually to testers whenever you upload a new release.

* The testers will not get any notifications regarding the upload.

* They should access the link with the same email account they have given.

* They will be asked to accept the invite to test. Once accepted, they will be taken to the play store.

* In the play store also they should be logged in to the same email account. Otherwise they will see an empty screen inside the play store app.

**Additional Notes**:

_KEYSTORE_

* If you are using pipeline to push the app to the play store, make sure that your keystore that you have used for the first time is used to sign the app while building.
* We have encoded the keystore file (the whole file and not the contents) to base64 and stored it in secret.
* Before building the app,  get the encoded file and decode it and place it in the right folder so that you can sign the app without any issues.


_PLAY STORE LIMITATIONS_

* You may want to increment the build number/ version code every time you upload a new apk/ app bundle.
* If the app is built using the same build number/ version code of the previous app, then play store will reject that build.
