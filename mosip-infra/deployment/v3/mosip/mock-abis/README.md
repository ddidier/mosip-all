# Mock ABIS

## Introduction
Unlike real ABIS we run mock abis inside the cluster itself.  The same connects to activemq via internal load balancer. See architecture [here](https://github.com/mosip/mosip-infra/blob/develop/deployment/v3/docs/images/deployment_architecture.png)

NOTE: Install mock abis **after** installing [Config Server](../mosip/config_server/README.md)
## Install
```sh
./install.sh
```
