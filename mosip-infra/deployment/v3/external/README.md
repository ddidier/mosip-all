# MOSIP External Components

This folder contains installation procedures for all components that are not part of core mosip offering - they need to be installed separately and integrated.  MOSIP has provided reference/mock implementations of some of these components that may be used for development and testing.  Some components may run inside the cluster itself, or outside depending on the choice of deployment.
